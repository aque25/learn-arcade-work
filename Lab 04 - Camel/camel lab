Welcome to Camel!
You have stolen a camel to make your way across the great Mobi desert.
The natives want their camel back and are chasing you down! Survive your
desert trek and outrun the natives.  The natives move at a constant speed of
3 miles per move.
Every time you move you get more thirsty and you camel gets more tired.
When you camel reaches tired level 5 he will die.
When you reach thirst level 4 you will die.
You have a total of 3 water, which will completely quench your thirst.
Finally, every time you move at moderate speed, you horse get 1x more tired and you get 1x more thirsty, 
and if you move at full speed, your horse gets 2x more tired and you get 1x more thirsty.
