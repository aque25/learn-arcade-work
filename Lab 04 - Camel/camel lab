Welcome to turtle land, where turtles kill you.
You have stolen a turtle baby and now you have to use it to swim out of th ocean.
His family is chasing you down, but their fatal flaw is they can't get out of water.
His family moves at a speed of 3 miles per move.
Every time you move you need more air, and the turtle child you kidnapped gets more tired.
When the turtle reaches tired level 5 he will die.
If you reach air deprivation level 4 you will die as well.
You ahve 3 air canteens, which you can breathe through to completely restore your air.
Finally, every time you move at moderate speed, you turtle captive will get 1x more tired and you get 1x more air depreived, 
and if you move at full speed, your turtle gets 2x more tired and you get 1x more air depreived.
Good Luck!
